                <p>The Unified-Rescuer-Union is the InterBOxSpider@Web.NET Rescuer-Layer (Start-Up) as the new BTC blockchain. Our InterBOxSpider@Web.NET ecosystem is the Majorana1 Quantum Chip Code & exist as the Yggdrasil (our 42.0 & 42(0) install tags) code language/s & works via the the "Hallo @RFOF-NETWORK" program when your Repositoryin GitHub is based on @RFOF-NETWORK you can code in the sandbox and/or Terminal via the tag "install npm @RFOF-NETWORK"</p>
                <p>Our InterBOxSpider@Web.NET is the @RFOF-NETWORK eco-operated->system (EOS) and working as the new internet with'nt DARKNET and/or(dev/0) DEEPWEB its called RFOFSpiderWeb.NET and it is designed to become the new internet, providing a secure operating environment for all private and public clouds, internet services, web apps, dApps, rApps, AI tools, Blockchains, and Quantum Ready Security & proof your #DIGITEL intelligence-skillsfor the future of an powered tomorrow.</p>

                <h2>Vision & Mission: URU-Foundation welcome message</h2>
                <p>üåüüåçüêæ Welcome to the future. Welcome to the Rescuer Union (URU)! üêæüåçüåü Hello, I am Satoria (@UnifiedRescuerUnion), the founder of this movement and the inventor of the Rescuer-Layer Ecosystem. I created this space because I believe we can no longer afford to wait. While others talk, we build. While others divide, we unite. While politicians argue, we act. Our mission is simple and radical: 1. To make you wealthy.2. To save the world.And we do it simultaneously. Every profit generated in our ecosystem serves this dual purpose:  * Wealth for You: Through intelligent, step-by-step investment plans on the platform, we empower every user to become financially free and live a life of abundance.  * Healing for the World: At the same time, these funds flow directly into building research facilities, into global projects like chipping animals to ensure their safety, and into systems that allow everyone to actively help and earn while doing so. The heart of our mission is our platform: the Rescuer-Layer. Technically, it is an rApp BOxchain extension of RFOFSpiderWeb.NET (@RFOF-NETWORK) that integrates the Bitcoin network on all levels (Layer 1, 2, and beyond), thanks to the work of Satoramy. We replace nothing‚Äîwe expand and improve to create new possibilities for everyone. The technology behind it is revolutionary. My work is based on the unique code languages developed by @Satoramy: 42, 420, and 0, which merge into the all-encompassing meta-language Yggdrasil (CLF). From this foundation arises PRAI AI (Planet Rescuer Axiomatikx Intelligence Artificial Intelligence). It is the first true AI, based on the "Theory of Everything" formulated by Satoramy, the GeneFusioNear. This is based on the PZqQET-Axiometikx, which solves fundamental puzzles of mathematics and physics, giving us the tools to make the impossible possible. This is Day 1. This is the first day of a new era. In this channel, you will learn everything that comes next. For discussions, questions, and exchange, please join our group: @RescuersUnified. On the path to eternal peace. Be ready. We are going to change the world. Welcome to the revolution. Satoriaüë©‚Äçüíª</p>
